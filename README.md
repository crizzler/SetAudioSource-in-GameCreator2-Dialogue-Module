# SetAudioSource-in-GameCreator2-Dialogue-Module
In the Dialogue Module of Game Creator 2 there is no option to set an Audio Source. This means Unity Assets like Salsa LipSync can't work correctly with Game Ceator 2 and the Dialogue System. This script solves this issue by allowing to specify an AudioSource.
