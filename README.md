# SetAudioSource-in-GameCreator2-Dialogue-Module
In the Dialogue Module of Game Creator 2 there is no option to set an Audio Source. This means Unity Assets like Salsa LipSync can't work correctly with Game Ceator 2 and the Dialogue System. This script solves this issue by allowing to specify an AudioSource.

Drag and drop the script into Assets/Plugins/GameCreator/Packages/Core/Runtime/Common/Polymorphism/Properties/Types/Get/Audio

In the Dialogue module is now an option to set an AudioSource at the "Audio" field.
